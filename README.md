# Project Description
This repository contains a data analysis of deaths due to infection in the Netherlands from 1950 to 2021. This data analysis was designed to examine the number of people who died due to infection by age and gender. It is a Python-based data visualization tool analyzes and presents death statistics. It uses Pandas for data manipulation, Bokeh and HoloViews for plotting, and Panel for creating interactive visualizations.

### Required Softwares
